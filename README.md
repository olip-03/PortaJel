Ghetto spotify for Jellyfin. Written with .net MAUI and Blazor pages. 

Hello to all passers-by. This app is not done, I'm working on it, but it's only realy public so job recruiters can see how pretty my HTML pages look. By the way, if you are a recruiter, hello! Grab a cup of tea and have a seat, it's nice to see you. 

As for what needs to be done, currently my plan is to have the app be fully navigable before actual 'audio player' functions are added in; meaning the user must be able to browse, search, and find tunes in the app, just as you would with something like Spotify or Apple Music. I still need to get my head around Android's media service so I can get that neat music player in the notifications tray, but that's all to be done at a later date. 

If you're interested in helping with this project, please feel free to! The less work I have to do, the better. Even more so if you're more experienced with some of the technologies going on here. I'm quite fresh to using .Net MAUI, and am very fresh to making mobile apps. Most of my work has either been for desktop or for web.

Thank you!
