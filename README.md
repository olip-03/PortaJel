Hello to all passers-by. This app is not done, I'm working on it, but it's only realy public so job recruiters can see how pretty my HTML pages look. By the way, if you are a recruiter, hello! Grab a cup of tea and have a seat, it's nice to see you. 

If you're interested in helping with this project, please feel free to! The less work I have to do, the better. Even more so if you're more experienced with some of the technologies going on here. I'm quite fresh to using .Net MAUI, and am very fresh to making mobile apps. Most of my work has either been for desktop or for web.

Current milestones: 
- Music playback with a controller is working (quite well too might I add)
- Nasty Android API stuff is on track (music playing in a foreground service and listening events for when the system requests to pause and skip, etc..)
- Browsing, liking, searching is implemented well (although a bit of work could be done tidying the UI, it's not a priority)
- UI/UX, I'm just personally kind of proud of this one, I think it's looking pretty sharp

Working on: 
- Finalization of media controller (looping and shuffle aren't there yet)
- Better support for Android API's (Media Notification isn't working yet)
- Downloading of songs and better caching of data 

Thank you!
